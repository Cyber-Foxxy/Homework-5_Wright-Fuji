# Homework-5_Wright-Fuji
road to Mount fuji
Pivoting the tone of this project was actually pretty fun. I put in all the important technical pieces—like the while loop used to reset the UI and the switch statement for handling the house choices. My favorite part of the logic is the dog encounter. The “return” option especially makes the interaction feel more dynamic, because instead of ending the story, it smoothly loops the player back into a different branch. That transition helps the story feel more intentional and interactive rather than linear.
